# 99 problems

Collected notes of the discussion.

## Starter

Do you think about time management? If yes, how much? If no, consciously not?

## Problems

* procrastination
* interruptions
* switching between tasks / projects / ...
  * lack of task clarity
* distractions (open door policy)
* overoptimization / overtooling
* balancing focus & breaks
* overbreaking -> procrastination
* overplanning, replanning
* finishing things / getting things done vs. starting new things -> good strategy for this?
* writing things up (how much time to spend on it?)

## Solutions / Tools

* Meyers-Briggs test -> handle with care
* close doors, headphones
* writing tasks down somewhere
* don't always work (in your office) -> you never know when you have the crucial insights
* not being too hard on yourself when you don't feel productive
* sometimes you just gotta get the shit done
* not beginning the day working can completely break productivity
* write / code such that others could understand this
* work when it works best (office space, destructions, ...)
* optimizing amount / length / type of breaks
  * powernaps
  * physical exercise (biking, walking, ...)
  * smoking (drugs in general)
  * get away from the laptop
* automatization
  * email filters, tags, ...
  * bash aliases, ...
  * subscriptions to journals
* Csiksentmihaly (Flow): challenge vs. competence (both need to be high)
  * use the flow / ride the wave
* tools
  * bulletjournal
  * pomodoro timer
  * emacs orgmode

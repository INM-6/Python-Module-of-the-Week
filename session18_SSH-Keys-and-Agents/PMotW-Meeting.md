## General considerations

  * ![](lock.jpg){width=20% .right }Trust-model using keys:<br>-- access is granted to whoever has the key
  *  Keys are generated as *key-pair*, one is used to crypt and one de-crypt data
  * you can have as many keys as you want


# SSH keys & agents

## Generate a key

    ssh-keygen -b 4096 -C "y.name@fz-juelich.de"

   * `-t` specifies the type of the key (default: rsa)
   * `-b` gives the nuber of bits (default 2048)
   * `-C` gives a useful identifier in the comment field (default `$USER@$HOST`)

. . .

   * ![](warning.svg){ height="130px" .right } **never** create a key without a password
   * give a useful filename, e.g. the identifier
   * protect your private key!

. . .

   This will produce two files, for example

   * `y.name@fz-juelich`
   * `y.name@fz-juelich.pub`

    ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQAB...Da9V08Ew== y.name@fz-juelich.de

## Using a key

   Add your public key to the file
   `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the destination machine

    ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQAB...Da9V08Ew== y.name@fz-juelich.de

   Then use your private key to log into the machine (`man ssh`)

    ssh -i y.name@fz-juelich  y.name@login.inm.kfa-juelich.de

. . .

### Note

   * The password you give is the *password of the key* not of the target machine
   * The private key is never transfered, the password is processed only *locally*

## The SSH Agent

   When frequently accessing a system it may be impractical to re-type the
   potentially longisch key password for each connection, esp. when connecting
   to other hosts in scripts.


## Start the agent

   NOTE: This is not necessary if the gnome-keyring is available!

   *wrong*

    $ ssh-agent
    SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-hHmOg2ChTmr4/agent.31758; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK;
    SSH_AGENT_PID=31759; export SSH_AGENT_PID;
    echo Agent pid 31759;

   *right*

    $ eval $(ssh-agent)


## Using the agent

   * if `$SSH_AUTH_SOCKET` is in your environment, the agent will be used

    ssh  y.name@login.inm.kfa-juelich.de

. . .

   * if you need to do more ssh connections on the remote side, you can
     1. tell `ssh` to "forward the ssh-agent socket" to the remote side

            ssh -A  y.name@login.inm.kfa-juelich.de

        or configure `ForwardAgent yes` (see next section)
     2. copy your encrypted private key to the intermediate machine


# Make your life easier:<br>`.ssh/config`

## The problem

   Even with the SSH agents lines can become annoying to re-type/remember

   * which key for which host
   * different required options
   * different usernames
   * ...

    ssh -X -o ForwardAgent=yes  y.name@login.inm.kfa-juelich.de
    ssh -o TCPKeepAlive=yes  yname1@jureca.fz-juelich.de
    ...

## Basic config

   Create/edit your `~/.ssh/config` (`man ssh_config`):

    Host login
        Hostname login.inm.kfa-juelich.de
        User y.name
        IdentitiesOnly yes
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/y.name@fz-juelich

. . .

   This lets you do

    ssh login

   which is then equivalent to

    ssh -i ~/.ssh/y.name@fz-juelich -o IdentitiesOnly=yes \ y.name@login.inm.kfa-juelich.de

# Usage examples

## cluster/HPC

    Host hambach
        HostName hambach.inm.kfa-juelich.de
        User terhorst
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/y.name@fz-juelich
        IdentitiesOnly yes

    Host jureca
        HostName jureca.fz-juelich.de
        User jinb3326
        KbdInteractiveAuthentication no
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/my-global-key
        IdentitiesOnly yes



## gitty/Github

### gitty

    Host gitty
        Hostname gitty.inm.kfa-juelich.de
        User git
        IdentitiesOnly yes
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/y.name@fz-juelich

   then run `ssh gitty`

### Github

   Go to your [github settings page](https://github.com/settings/keys) "SSH and GPG keys" and add your public key

### cloning repositories

    git clone gitty:csn_toolbox
    git clone github:INM-6/equipment-overview


## sshfs vs. rsync

### Sync remote files

   Using the agent and ssh-config things become very easy:

    ssh login
    date >somefile
    rsync -avi login:somefile .


. . .

### Using `sshfs`

    mkdir remote
    sshfs login: remote
    ls remote
    fusermount -u remote

. . .

#### NOTE

   With sshfs processes still run locally!
   Only files are transfered! Huge difference in speed and responsiveness


# Finally

## Summary

   * no additional software/aliasses/scripts required
   * things become much easier and safer

#### â†’ Discuss!

. . .

### Not covered

   * different users on same host
   * Control channels
   * Connection forwarding

# Thanks!

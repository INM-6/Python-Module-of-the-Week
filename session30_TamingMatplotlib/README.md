This session essentially consisted of me (Alex R) going through one big mind map. The file was produced with [XMind](https://www.xmind.net/); you can download the trial version to view and edit the original file. You can also open the PDF if you just want to read it.

## Getting started

I highly recommend reading through the [matplotlib tutorials](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html). This independently of your current level – there's some pretty advanced stuff in there.

In order to navigate the documentation, you need to know what things are called. For this, the [anatomy of a plot](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/showcase/anatomy.html) can be a useful starting point.

**Suggestions welcome !** It would be great if this document became a useful consultation resource. If you find yourself thinking “I would refer to it, if only it had…” or “[…], if only it was formatted as…”, then please suggest an improvement !

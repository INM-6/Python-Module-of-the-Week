## Twitter mechanics
* Tweet: message consisting of 280 characters + image/gif/video
* Mentions: e.g. using [@PyElephant](https://twitter.com/PyElephant) in a tweet references and alerts the PyElephant twitter account
* Hashtags: e.g. [#neuromorphic](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23neuromorphic) references a keyword/subject and makes the tweet findable via this #
* Follow: you can follow other accounts (@...) and also hashtags (#...)
* Feed: your feed is composed of tweets and activity by the accounts you follow
* Retweet: retweeting a tweet forwards it to your followers (attaching a comment is possible)
* Reply: tweeting as message as reply interlinks the tweets, so that conversations are traceable.
* Like: shows your approval of a tweet, saves it in a list of all your likes.
* DM: direct message, only possible when both accounts follow each other
* Bio: short description of the account

Protip: to better organize feeds, mentions, notifications, etc. use [TweetDeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/).

## #BrainTC
Some people go to [extreme length](https://chi2019.acm.org/for-attendees/remote-attendance/) to avoid the burden of traveling to conferences while still attending conferences. But there has to be a better way...

The yearly [Brain Twitter Conference](https://brain.tc/) is a virtual conference, consisting of all the basic component of a regular conference: talks, keynotes, discussions, a strict schedule, coffee breaks, and social events.

However, because it takes place virtually on Twitter, it also is inclusive, open, international, and doesn't come with the financial, time, and environmental cost of traveling to some (remote) venue.

* talks and keynotes: 6 successive tweets within 15 minutes, for example like [dis](https://twitter.com/RealBrainTC/status/971717491897589760) or [dat](https://twitter.com/RealBrainTC/status/971819097053941760).
* discussions: Questions, comments, and answers are posted during and after the talks as replies to the talk-tweets.
* coffee breaks: These are essential, this conference otherwise goes for 19 hours straight!
* social events: invite friends, have a beer.

To attend you just need to join twitter, and follow either [#brainTC](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23braintc&src=typd) or [@RealBrainTC](https://twitter.com/RealBrainTC). To start a discussion you just need to click on the *reply* button below a tweet.

So, save the date!
Thursday **14.03.2019**.
All the time from 5:45 to 00:30.

If this is too overwhelming, [here](https://onervakorhonen.wordpress.com/2019/03/12/5-2-tips-for-the-braintc/) is a subjective recommendation for 7 promising talks, by one of the organizers.

And at 18:30 @rgutzen will present ["How much do you trust a model? - Rigor in neuroscientific modeling and simulation through validation"](insert link here)
